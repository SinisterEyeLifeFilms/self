      Sinister Eye Life Films&apos; SELF is a film collection that examines and explores our
      own inner lives, how we see ourselves and others, and how others see us. The
      films are experimental and rarely straightforward, encouraging viewers to
      question everything we take for granted to be true and real.

      Colour, particularly the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue, is used
      repeatedly in the films, echoing the work of artists such as Piet Mondrian, Yves
      Klein, and Barnett Newman, as well as film directors such as Krzysztof
      Kielowski, Jean-Luc Godard, and Pedro Almod√≥var.

      A common theme is the body and how it expresses or conceals emotion and
      self. Body dysmorphia is used to depict internal conflict and self-doubt. The
      outer body is a reflection of the inner psyche. Nothing is concealed.

      Hugh Murphy returned to college in his late fifties to &rdquo;do what he loved&rdquo;. His
      work has evolved from 2D print experiments to multifaceted conceptual
      pieces. His current work is digital and video-based, ranging from
      documentaries to more abstract videos about our own inner psyche.
